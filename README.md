# Project Type - EDA

# Project Summary -
Business Context

FedEx Logistics operates a vast and intricate global supply chain, handling shipments across multiple regions, countries, and industries. The company deals with various logistics processes, including purchase orders (POs), shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and product-specific details such as item descriptions and dosage forms. Effective management of these logistics components is crucial to ensuring timely deliveries, minimizing freight costs, and maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction.

With the increasing demand for eCommerce and global distribution, logistics companies must continuously refine their operations to stay competitive. The dataset used in this analysis provides valuable insights into FedEx’s shipment management, helping to identify bottlenecks, optimize freight routes, and enhance cost-effectiveness. By leveraging data analytics, FedEx aims to improve supply chain operations, reduce costs, and enhance overall efficiency.
