# Project Type - EDA

# Project Summary -
Business Context

FedEx Logistics operates a vast and intricate global supply chain, handling shipments across multiple regions, countries, and industries. The company deals with various logistics processes, including purchase orders (POs), shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and product-specific details such as item descriptions and dosage forms. Effective management of these logistics components is crucial to ensuring timely deliveries, minimizing freight costs, and maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction.

With the increasing demand for eCommerce and global distribution, logistics companies must continuously refine their operations to stay competitive. The dataset used in this analysis provides valuable insights into FedEx’s shipment management, helping to identify bottlenecks, optimize freight routes, and enhance cost-effectiveness. By leveraging data analytics, FedEx aims to improve supply chain operations, reduce costs, and enhance overall efficiency.

# FedEx Performance Analysis - Power BI Report

### **Business Objective**
The purpose of this report is to analyze FedEx's shipping performance across different shipment modes, countries, and vendors. The goal is to identify key areas for cost optimization, improve delivery efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction by reducing delays and cancellations. This report provides insights into shipment volumes, freight costs, time-based performance, and shipment trends to assist stakeholders in making informed strategic decisions.

---

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
- **Total Shipments:** 10K
- **Total Freight Cost:** $93M
- **Average Delivery Delay:** 21 days
- **Early Deliveries:** 31
- **Cancellation Rate:** 100%

---

### **Time Analysis**
1. **Delivery Delays by Shipment Mode**
   - Ocean shipments experience the highest delays, while Air Charter has the least delays.
   - Ocean shipments are the lowest in volume, whereas Air shipments are the highest.

2. **On-Time vs. Late Shipments**
   - Most shipments are delivered on time, while late shipments represent a minimal proportion.

3. **Delivery Delays by Country and Vendor**
   - **Country-wise:** Congo DRC has the highest delays, while Senegal has the least delays.
   - **Vendor-wise:** JSI R&T Institute Inc. records the highest delays, whereas Sun Pharma Ind Ltd has the lowest delays.

4. **Shipment Mode and Delivery Performance**
   - Air shipments have the highest volume and on-time deliveries, while ocean shipments have the lowest for both metrics.
